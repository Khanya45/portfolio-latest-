              Khanya is a sweet and charismatic individual. She is talented
              intellectually and poetically. An asset not only to her peers but
              I believe at any company as well.

              Khanya is one of the best students we have in the academy. Her
              ability too learn new technologies is incredible. She posses great
              problem solving skills. She has great personality and works well
              within a team. I believe she can be a great person to have in a
              team as a Junior Full-stack developer.

              Khanya regularly produces creative and original projects
              well-attuned to the requirements of the briefs. She presents her
              ideas without being aggressively over-confident. I recommend her.
